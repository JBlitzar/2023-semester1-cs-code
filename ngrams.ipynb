It has been superseded by recurrent neural network-based models, which has been superseded by large language models. [1] It is based on an assumption that the probability of the next word in a sequence depends only on a fixed size window of previous words. If only one previous word was considered, it was called a bigram model; if two words, a trigram model; if n-1 words, an n-gram model.[2] Special tokens were introduced to denote the start and end of a sentence \n",

    "Out-of-vocabulary words\n",
    "Main article: Statistical machine translation\n",
    "An issue when using n-gram language models are out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. They are encountered in computational linguistics and natural language processing when the input includes words which were not present in a system's dictionary or database during its preparation. By default, when a language model is estimated, the entire observed vocabulary is used. In some cases, it may be necessary to estimate the language model with a specific fixed vocabulary. In such a scenario, the n-grams in the corpus that contain an out-of-vocabulary word are ignored. The n-gram probabilities are smoothed over all the words in the vocabulary even if they were not observed.[4]\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, it is essential in some cases to explicitly model the probability of out-of-vocabulary words by introducing a special token (e.g. <unk>) into the vocabulary. Out-of-vocabulary words in the corpus are effectively replaced with this special <unk> token before n-grams counts are cumulated. With this option, it is possible to estimate the transition probabilities of n-grams involving out-of-vocabulary words.[5]\n",

    "n-grams for approximate matching\n",

    "26\n",
    "3\n",
    "26^3-dimensional space (the first dimension measures the number of occurrences of \"aaa\", the second \"aab\", and so forth for all possible combinations of three letters). Using this representation, we lose information about the string. However, we know empirically that if two strings of real text have a similar vector representation (as measured by cosine distance) then they are likely to be similar. Other metrics have also been applied to vectors of n-grams with varying, sometimes better, results. For example, z-scores have been used to compare documents by examining how many standard deviations each n-gram differs from its mean occurrence in a large collection, or text corpus, of documents (which form the \"background\" vector). In the event of small counts, the g-score (also known as g-test) gave better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to take a more principled approach to the statistics of n-grams, modeling similarity as the likelihood that two strings came from the same source directly in terms of a problem in Bayesian inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "n-gram-based searching was also used for plagiarism detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias-versus-variance trade-off\n",
    "To choose a value for n in an n-gram model, it is necessary to find the right trade-off between the stability of the estimate against its appropriateness. This means that trigram (i.e. triplets of words) is a common choice with large training corpora (millions of words), whereas a bigram is often used with smaller ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Smoothing techniques\n",
    "There are problems of balance weight between infrequent grams (for example, if a proper name appeared in the training data) and frequent grams. Also, items not seen in the training data will be given a probability of 0.0 without smoothing. For unseen but plausible data from a sample, one can introduce pseudocounts. Pseudocounts are generally motivated on Bayesian grounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice it was necessary to smooth the probability distributions by also assigning non-zero probabilities to unseen words or n-grams. The reason is that models derived directly from the n-gram frequency counts have severe problems when confronted with any n-grams that have not explicitly been seen before – the zero-frequency problem. Various smoothing methods were used, from simple \"add-one\" (Laplace) smoothing (assign a count of 1 to unseen n-grams; see Rule of succession) to more sophisticated models, such as Good–Turing discounting or back-off models. Some of these methods are equivalent to assigning a prior distribution to the probabilities of the n-grams and using Bayesian inference to compute the resulting posterior n-gram probabilities. However, the more sophisticated smoothing models were typically not derived in this fashion, but instead through independent considerations.\n",

    "Syntactic n-grams are intended to reflect syntactic structure more faithfully than linear n-grams, and have many of the same applications, especially as features in a vector space model.
